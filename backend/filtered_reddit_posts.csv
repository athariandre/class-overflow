CSCE 120,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/qg6h61/csce_120/,7,1635255141.0,I'm a freshman in general engineering trying to get into computer engineering and previously you were supposed to take csce 121 but now it says csce 120. Has anybody taken this class this semester and what is it like? What professor would you recommend?
Couple of registration questions,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/ozfx7b/couple_of_registration_questions/,5,1628285052.0,"1. I'm trying to register for my classes and a lot of them will have really low numbers, like one of the sections has ""Act: 3 Max: 0 Avl: -3."" Does this mean that more seats are going to be opened or is it saying that 3 people got forced in?
2. If I were to submit a force request, how late would be too late? I'd like to keep trying to get the profs I want rather than leaving it up to the department to pick, at least for a little while.
3. Can someone explain the difference between CSCE 120 and 1"
Do I have to talk to advisors regarding course substitutions not counting in the degree evaluations within the degree planner?,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/ntenc1/do_i_have_to_talk_to_advisors_regarding_course/,3,1622957928.0,"I just got into my major for engineering so I’ve never had to care much for a degree plan until now. I have a few courses that count toward my degree but the degree evaluation doesn’t recognize them. For example, I recently took MATH 253 (Calc 3) at Blinn but since it’s not MATH 251, the Calc 3 course at TAMU, it isn’t recognized by the degree evaluation. They also recently changed CSCE 121 into CSCE 120 and since I’m taking CSCE 121 in the Fall, my degree plan doesn’t recognize it because it’s "
CSCE 120 vs CSCE 121,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/niyo8r/csce_120_vs_csce_121/,8,1621739226.0,"In computer engineering they're substituting CSCE 120 for CSCE 121, anybody know what class is better to take? CSCE 121 is Intro to Program Design and Concepts and 4 credits and has only the prerequisite of high school programming while 120 is Program Design and concepts and 3 credits and requires ENGR 102. In computer science and electrical engineering it's still 121. Which one should I take if I have the option to take either?"
