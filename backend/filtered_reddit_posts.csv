How much programming is involved, i'm in CSCE 121 with daugherity right now, and im hanging on, but it easily takes the most time out of differential equations/ stat 211, and my humanities class.  Will CSCE 221 be around the same time commitment? "

CSCE 221/222 advice?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/4eelsx/csce_221222_advice/,6,1460436095.0,"So, I switched majors last semester and I was planning on taking CSCE 121 over the summer online in order not to waste a semester. As such, I will be able to take CSCE 221 and 222 for Fall 2016.

The thing is, there are only two professors available:

-Teresa Leyk for CSCE 221
-Philip C. Ritchey for CSCE 222

Both of the above have pretty awful ratings for their respective classes. I've read Leyk can barely speak English...

Anyone taken these two and actually learned/made a good grade/survived?"

I was able to sign up for everything except 221 and 222. Normally these two are taken in the second semester but I thought I could take all four of the first year CSCE classes in one semester. The prerequisite said

Help on registering for classes!,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/3227j6/help_on_registering_for_classes/,7,1428623836.0,"Howdy!

So today I was signing up for classes, and I try to sign up for CSCE 221. I am currently enrolled in CSCE 121, which was the prerequisite. But I couldn't sign up for 221 because of the prerequisite/grade error?
Also, I was signing up for HLTH 236, per my advisor's advice, and I also couldn't because of a major restriction. I check the requirements, and apparently it *is* major restricted.

I wanted help about the CSCE 221, and clarification for HLTH, if that's okay. Thanks!
