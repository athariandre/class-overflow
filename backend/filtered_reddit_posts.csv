Can I take a corequisite class beforehand,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/1d4hu3u/can_i_take_a_corequisite_class_beforehand/,6,1717112610.0,"I am currently making my course plan for college, and I'm wondering if I take a class that is marked as a corequisite for a class a semester before I take that class, if I will be made to take the corequisite again at the same time.

For example, ECEN 350 is a corequisite for 313, and it specifically says: ""Prerequisite: CSCE 221 with a grade of C or better; grade of C or better in CSCE 313 or **concurrent enrollment in CSCE 350 or ECEN 350.**""

Edit: Replaced CSCE 312 with CSCE 313"

Advice about dropping class CSCE Major,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/10h3lsd/advice_about_dropping_class_csce_major/,5,1674237620.0,"Currently taking CSCE 312, CSCE 314, and CSCE 421 Machine Language (Bobak Mortazavi). Along with MATH 308, and MATH 470 Cryptography (William Rundell). For a course load of 16 hours.

I'm considering dropping one of these two classes -CSCE 421 or MATH 470. The CSCE class seems the most unorganized so I'm leaning toward that class. However I have heard that taking 470 with Rundell can be more challenging than the class has to be. I'm interested and want to take both eventually -just unsure of my "

I've seen a few of these here before and I wanted to gain some insight on my current semester and to see if you fine A&M peeps can lead me in the right direction.  


I plan on taking these 4 classes:

**CSCE 312 - Computer Organization**  
**CSCE 441 - Computer graphics**  
**GEOG 203 - Planet Earth**

Should I continue in CS?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aggies/comments/kagw2b/should_i_continue_in_cs/,14,1607612918.0,"I got back my grades recently and I have a B in CSCE 221. I got a B in CSCE 121 as well but it didn’t affect my gpa because of pass fail last sem. My question is, should I still continue as a CS major?( Technically I am a BA Computing major). I understand that it only gets harder from this point on so I want to know whether I should keep the major or stick to a minor. 

I’m sure I’ll get an A in CSCE 312, 314 that I’ve also taken.

Would appreciate any advice!"
